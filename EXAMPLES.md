# Timer Action Examples

This document provides examples of using the Switch For Time timer action with standard Home Assistant cards.

## Overview

With the new timer action feature, you can add timer functionality to ANY existing Home Assistant card (tile, entity, button, etc.) without needing to use the custom `switch-for-time-card`. This allows you to:

- Add timer popups to standard cards through `tap_action`
- Show timer badges on any card to display remaining time
- Keep your existing card configurations while adding timer functionality

## How It Works

The integration now provides:
1. **Timer Popup**: A global dialog that can be triggered from any card
2. **Timer Badge**: A visual indicator showing remaining time that can be added to any card
3. **Global Action Handler**: Automatically loaded when the integration is installed

## Basic Tile Card with Timer

Add timer functionality to a standard tile card:

```yaml
type: tile
entity: switch.shelly_plug_skimmer
icon: mdi:pool
vertical: false
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: browser_mod.popup
  data:
    title: Timer
    content:
      type: custom
      custom: switch-for-time-popup
      entity: switch.shelly_plug_skimmer
      durations:
        - 10
        - 20
        - 30
      action: toggle
      revert_to: previous
```

## Simplified Approach with Custom Script

For easier integration, you can use JavaScript to trigger the timer popup:

```yaml
type: tile
entity: switch.bathroom_fan
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: browser_mod.javascript
  data:
    code: >
      window.switchForTimeAction(this.hass, {
        entity: 'switch.bathroom_fan',
        durations: [5, 10, 15, 30],
        action: 'on',
        revert_to: 'previous'
      })
```

## Using Custom Actions (Recommended)

The easiest way is to use the fire-dom-event action directly:

```yaml
type: tile
entity: switch.pool_pump
tap_action:
  action: fire-dom-event
  fire_dom_event:
    event: switch-for-time-action
    detail:
      hass: "{{ hass }}"
      config:
        entity: switch.pool_pump
        durations: [30, 60, 120, 240]
        action: toggle
        revert_to: previous
        allow_custom_duration: true
```

## Entity Card with Timer Badge

Add a timer badge overlay to show remaining time:

```yaml
type: custom:mod-card
card:
  type: entity
  entity: light.living_room
  tap_action:
    action: fire-dom-event
    fire_dom_event:
      event: switch-for-time-action
      detail:
        config:
          entity: light.living_room
          durations: [15, 30, 60]
          action: toggle
          revert_to: previous
card_mod:
  style: |
    :host {
      position: relative;
    }
extra_entity:
  type: custom:switch-for-time-badge
  entity: light.living_room
```

## Button Card with Timer

```yaml
type: button
entity: fan.bedroom_fan
tap_action:
  action: fire-dom-event
  fire_dom_event:
    event: switch-for-time-action
    detail:
      config:
        entity: fan.bedroom_fan
        durations: [10, 20, 30]
        action: on
        revert_to: off
```

## Multiple Cards in Grid

```yaml
type: grid
columns: 2
cards:
  - type: tile
    entity: switch.outlet_1
    tap_action:
      action: fire-dom-event
      fire_dom_event:
        event: switch-for-time-action
        detail:
          config:
            entity: switch.outlet_1
            durations: [10, 20, 30]

  - type: tile
    entity: switch.outlet_2
    tap_action:
      action: fire-dom-event
      fire_dom_event:
        event: switch-for-time-action
        detail:
          config:
            entity: switch.outlet_2
            durations: [15, 30, 60]
```

## Configuration Options

All standard configuration options are supported:

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `entity` | string | yes | - | Entity ID to control |
| `durations` | array | yes | - | List of durations in minutes (1-8 entries) |
| `action` | string | no | `toggle` | Action: `on`, `off`, or `toggle` |
| `revert_to` | string | no | `previous` | Revert state: `previous`, `on`, `off`, `none` |
| `name` | string | no | - | Override entity friendly name |
| `icon` | string | no | - | Override entity icon |
| `allow_custom_duration` | boolean | no | `false` | Show custom duration input |
| `confirm_cancel` | boolean | no | `false` | Confirm before canceling |
| `theme.popup_title` | string | no | - | Custom popup title template |
| `theme.button_format` | string | no | - | Custom button label format |

## Advanced: Using with card-mod for Badge Overlay

```yaml
type: custom:mod-card
card:
  type: tile
  entity: switch.irrigation_system
  tap_action:
    action: fire-dom-event
    fire_dom_event:
      event: switch-for-time-action
      detail:
        config:
          entity: switch.irrigation_system
          durations: [5, 10, 15, 20]
          action: on
          revert_to: off
          theme:
            popup_title: "Run {name} for..."
            button_format: "{minutes} min"
card_mod:
  style: |
    :host {
      position: relative;
    }
    switch-for-time-badge {
      position: absolute;
      top: 8px;
      right: 8px;
      z-index: 999;
    }
elements:
  - type: custom:switch-for-time-badge
    entity: switch.irrigation_system
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timer popup doesn't appear

1. Ensure the Switch For Time integration is installed and configured
2. Verify the frontend JavaScript is loaded (check browser console)
3. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Badge doesn't show

1. Make sure you're using card-mod or a card that supports custom elements
2. Verify the entity ID matches exactly
3. Check that a timer is actually active for that entity

### Custom event not firing

1. Some cards may not support `fire-dom-event` action
2. Try using the `browser_mod.javascript` approach instead
3. Ensure you're passing the correct configuration format

## Migration from custom:switch-for-time-card

If you're currently using the custom card, you can migrate to standard cards:

**Before:**
```yaml
type: custom:switch-for-time-card
entity: switch.fan
durations: [10, 20, 30]
action: on
revert_to: previous
```

**After:**
```yaml
type: tile
entity: switch.fan
tap_action:
  action: fire-dom-event
  fire_dom_event:
    event: switch-for-time-action
    detail:
      config:
        entity: switch.fan
        durations: [10, 20, 30]
        action: on
        revert_to: previous
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Use any standard Home Assistant card
- ✅ No need to learn custom card syntax
- ✅ Consistent with other card actions
- ✅ Easier to maintain and update
- ✅ Works with card-mod and other customizations
- ✅ Better performance (no custom card overhead)
